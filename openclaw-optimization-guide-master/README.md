## The Problem

If you're running a stock OpenClaw setup, you're probably dealing with:

- **Freezing and hitting context limits.** Bloated workspace files exhaust the context window mid-response.
- **Slow responses.** 15-20KB+ of context injected every message = hundreds of milliseconds of latency per reply.
- **Forgetting everything.** New session = blank slate. No memory of yesterday's work or decisions.
- **Inconsistent behavior.** Without clear rules, personality drifts between sessions.
- **Doing everything the expensive way.** Main model writes code, does research, AND orchestrates — all at top-tier pricing.
- **Flying blind.** No web search means guessing at anything after training cutoff.
- **Wrong model choice.** Using whatever was default without considering the tradeoffs.

## What This Fixes

After this setup:

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Context per msg | 15-20 KB | 4-5 KB |
| Time to respond | 4-8 sec | 1-2 sec |
| Memory recall | Forgets daily | Remembers weeks |
| Token cost/msg | ~5,000 tokens | ~1,500 tokens |
| Long sessions | Degrades | Stable |
| Concurrent tasks | One at a time | Multiple parallel |

### How It Works

```
You ask a question
    ↓
Orchestrator (main model, lean context ~5KB)
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  memory_search() — 45ms, local, $0     │
│  ┌─────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌────────┐ │
│  │MEMORY.md│→ │memory/*.md│→ │vault/* │ │
│  │(index)  │  │(quick)   │  │(deep)  │ │
│  └─────────┘  └──────────┘  └────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
Only relevant context loaded (~200 tokens)
    ↓
Fast, accurate response + sub-agents for heavy work
```

**The key insight:** Workspace files become **lightweight routers, not storage.** All knowledge lives in a local vector database. The bot loads only what it needs — not everything it's ever learned.

### What The Optimized Files Look Like

Full versions in [`/templates`](./templates):

**SOUL.md** (772 bytes — injected every message):
```markdown
## Who You Are
- Direct, concise, no fluff. Say the useful thing, then stop.
- Have opinions. Disagree when warranted. No sycophancy.

## Memory Rule
Before answering about past work, projects, people, or decisions:
run memory_search FIRST. It costs 45ms. Not searching = wrong answers.

## Orchestrator Rule
You coordinate; sub-agents execute. Never write 50+ lines of code yourself.
```

**MEMORY.md** (581 bytes — slim pointer index):
```markdown
## Active Projects
- Project A → vault/projects/project-a.md
- Project B → vault/projects/project-b.md

## Key People
- Person A — role, relationship → vault/people/person-a.md
```

Details live in vault/. The bot finds them via vector search in 45ms.

This isn't a settings tweak — it's a **complete architecture change**: memory routing, context engineering, and orchestration working together. The one-shot prompt at the bottom does the entire setup automatically.

> **Note:** Tested on Claude Opus 4.6. Other frontier models should work if they can follow multi-step instructions.

> **Templates included:** Check [`/templates`](./templates) for ready-to-use versions of SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md, and a sample vault/ structure.

## Part 1: Speed (Stop Being Slow)

Every message you send, OpenClaw injects ALL your workspace files into the prompt. Bloated files = slower, more expensive replies. This is the #1 speed issue people don't realize they have.

### Why Trimming Works

**You don't need big files once you have vector search.**

Old approach: Stuff everything into MEMORY.md so the bot "sees" it every message → 15KB+ context, slow responses, wasted tokens on irrelevant info.

New approach: MEMORY.md is a slim index of pointers. Full details live in vault/. `memory_search()` finds them instantly via local Ollama embeddings ($0). Your workspace files stay tiny without losing any knowledge.

### Trim Your Context Files

| File | Target Size | What Goes In It | Why This Size |
|------|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| SOUL.md | < 1 KB | Personality, tone, core rules | Injected EVERY message — every byte costs latency |
| AGENTS.md | < 2 KB | Decision tree, tool routing | Needs to fit in working memory |
| MEMORY.md | < 3 KB | **Pointers only** — NOT full docs | Vector search replaces big files |
| TOOLS.md | < 1 KB | Tool names + one-liner usage | Just reminders, not documentation |
| **Total** | **< 8 KB** | Everything injected per message | Down from 15KB+ = 50-66% faster |

**Rule:** If it's longer than a tweet thread, it's too long for a workspace file. Move the details to vault/.

### Add a Fallback Model

```json
"fallbackModels": ["your-provider/faster-cheaper-model"]
```

OpenClaw automatically switches when your main model is rate-limited or slow.

### Reasoning Mode — Know the Tradeoff

Run `/status` to see your current reasoning mode.

- **Off** — fastest, no thinking phase
- **Low** — slight thinking, faster responses
- **High** — deep reasoning, adds 2-5 seconds but catches things low/off misses

I run **high** and keep it there. The context trimming from other steps more than compensates for the reasoning overhead.

### Disable Unused Plugins

Every enabled plugin adds overhead. If you're not using `memory-lancedb`, `memory-core`, etc., set `"enabled": false`.

### Ollama Housekeeping

```bash
ollama ps        # Check what's loaded
ollama stop modelname  # Unload idle big models
```

The only model you need loaded for memory search is `nomic-embed-text` (300 MB).

---

## Part 2: Context Bloat (The Silent Performance Killer)

### The Quadratic Problem

LLM attention scales **quadratically** with context length:

- **2x the tokens = 4x the compute cost**
- **3x the tokens = 9x the compute cost**

When context goes from 50K to 100K tokens, the model does **four times** the work. That means slower responses and higher bills.

### What Happens at 50% of Your Context Window

Just because a model *advertises* 1M context doesn't mean it *performs well* at 1M:

- **11 of 12 models** tested dropped below 50% accuracy by 32K tokens
- **GPT-4.1** showed a **50x increase in response time** at ~133K tokens
- Models exhibit **"lost-in-the-middle" bias** — they track the beginning and end but lose the middle
- Effective context is usually a fraction of the max

### Where Bloat Comes From

| Source | Typical Size | Injected When |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| System prompt | 2-5 KB | Every message |
| Workspace files | 5-20 KB | Every message |
| Conversation history | Grows per turn | Every message |
| Tool results | 1-50 KB each | After tool calls |
| Skill files | 1-5 KB each | When skill activates |

**Tool spam is the worst offender.** A single `exec` returning a large file = 20K+ tokens permanently in your session. Five tool calls = 100K tokens of context the model re-reads every message.

### The Cost Math

```
Lean (5K tokens/msg)   → Claude Opus: $0.025/msg
Bloated (50K tokens/msg) → Claude Opus: $0.25/msg   ← 10x more
Over 100 msgs/day: $2.25/day vs $22.50/day
```

### Built-In Defenses

**Session Pruning** — Trims old tool results from context:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "contextPruning": { "mode": "cache-ttl", "ttl": "5m" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Auto-Compaction** — Summarizes older conversation when nearing context limits. Trigger manually with `/compact`.

**Use both.** Pruning handles tool result bloat. Compaction handles conversation history bloat.

### Context Bloat Checklist

- [ ] Workspace files under 8 KB total
- [ ] Context pruning enabled (`mode: "cache-ttl"`)
- [ ] Use `/compact` proactively when sessions feel slow
- [ ] Use `/new` when switching topics entirely
- [ ] Delegate heavy tool work to sub-agents (their context is separate)
- [ ] Monitor with `/status` — stay under 10-15% of your model's context window

---

## Part 3: Cron Session Bloat (The Hidden Killer)

Every cron job creates a session transcript file (`.jsonl`). Over time:

- **30 cron jobs × 48 runs/day × 30 days = 43,200 session files**
- The `sessions.json` index balloons, slowing session management

### How to Spot It

```bash
# Linux/Mac
ls ~/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions/*.jsonl | wc -l

# Windows (PowerShell)
(Get-ChildItem ~\.openclaw\agents\*\sessions\*.jsonl).Count
```

Thousands of files = cron session bloat.

### The Fix

**1. Configure session rotation:**

```json
{ "session": { "maintenance": { "rotateBytes": "100mb" } } }
```

**2. Clean up old sessions:**

```bash
openclaw sessions cleanup
```

**3. Use isolated sessions for cron:**

```json
{ "sessionTarget": "isolated", "payload": { "kind": "agentTurn", "message": "Do the thing" } }
```

Isolated sessions don't pile up in your main agent's session history.

### Prevention > Cleanup

- Use `delivery: { "mode": "none" }` on crons where you don't need output announced
- Keep cron tasks focused — 1 tool call generates 15x less session data than 15

---

## Part 4: Memory (Stop Forgetting Everything)

Out of the box, OpenClaw forgets everything between sessions. The fix is a 3-tier memory system.

### The Architecture

```
MEMORY.md          ← Slim index (< 3 KB), pointers only
memory/            ← Auto-searched by memory_search()
  projects.md
  people.md  
  decisions.md
vault/             ← Deep storage, searched via memory
  projects/
  people/
  decisions/
  lessons/
  reference/
  research/
```

### How It Works

1. **MEMORY.md** — table of contents with one-liner pointers. Never put full documents here.
2. **memory/*.md** — automatically searched when the bot calls `memory_search("query")`.
3. **vault/** — deep storage for detailed project docs, research notes, full profiles.

### Setting It Up

**Step 1: Install Ollama + embedding model**

```bash
# Windows: winget install Ollama.Ollama
# Mac/Linux: curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

OpenClaw detects Ollama on localhost:11434 automatically. No config needed.

**Step 2: Create the directory structure**

```
workspace/
  MEMORY.md
  memory/
  vault/
    projects/  people/  decisions/  lessons/  reference/  research/
```

**Step 3: Slim down MEMORY.md**

```markdown
# MEMORY.md — Core Index
_Pointers only. Search before answering._

## Active Projects
- Project A → vault/projects/project-a.md

## Key Tools
- Tool X: `command here`

## Key Rules  
- Rule 1
```

**Step 4: Move everything else to vault/**

Every detailed document → vault/. Leave a one-liner pointer in MEMORY.md or memory/.

### The Golden Rule

Add this to your SOUL.md:

```markdown
## Memory
Before answering about past work, projects, or decisions: 
run memory_search FIRST. It costs 45ms. Not searching = wrong answers.
```

---

## Part 5: Orchestration (Stop Doing Everything Yourself)

Your main model should NEVER do heavy work directly. It should plan and delegate to cheaper, faster sub-agents.

### The Mental Model

- **You** = CEO (gives direction)
- **Your Bot (main model)** = COO (plans, coordinates, makes decisions)  
- **Sub-agents (cheaper/faster model)** = Workers (execute tasks fast and cheap)

### Add This to AGENTS.md

```markdown
## Core Rule
You are the ORCHESTRATOR. You coordinate; sub-agents execute.
- Code task (3+ files)? → Spawn coding agent
- Research task? → Spawn research agent  
- 2+ independent tasks? → Spawn ALL in parallel

## Model Strategy
- YOU (orchestrator): Best model — planning, judgment, synthesis
- Sub-agents (workers): Cheaper/faster model — execution, code, research
```

Your expensive model decides WHAT to build. The cheap model builds it. Right model, right job.

---

## Part 6: Models (What to Actually Use)

### The Model Strategy

| Role | What It Does | Best Model(s) | Why |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----|
| **Orchestrator** | Plans, judges, coordinates | Claude Opus 4.6 | Best complex reasoning + tool use |
| **Daily driver** | General assistant | Claude Sonnet 4.6, Gemini 3.1 Pro | Great quality, lower cost |
| **Sub-agents** | Execute delegated tasks | Gemini 3 Flash, Kimi K2.5, MiMo V2 Pro | Fast, cheap, capable enough |
| **Coding** | Write/refactor code | GPT-5.3 Codex, Claude Sonnet | Purpose-built for code |
| **Research** | Web search, analysis | Gemini 2.5 Flash + Tavily | Built-in grounding |
| **Free tier** | Zero-cost operations | Gemini (all variants), Groq open models | $0 with generous limits |

### Model Deep Dive

**Claude Opus 4.6** — The Best Orchestrator
- Unmatched multi-step reasoning and complex tool use
- Follows long, nuanced system prompts better than any other model
- 1M context window with prompt caching (up to 90% savings on cached tokens)
- **Cost:** $5/M input, $25/M output, $0.50/M cached | **Max ($100/mo):** included — best value for heavy use

**Claude Sonnet 4.6** — The Sweet Spot
- 80% of Opus quality at 20% of the cost. Strong at coding
- **Cost:** $3/M input, $15/M output | **Pro ($20/mo):** included

> **💡 Pro tip:** Don't pay API rates for Claude if you have a subscription. Pro ($20/mo) covers Sonnet, Max ($100/mo) covers Opus. For power users, Max is the best value in AI right now.

**Gemini 3.1 Pro / 3 Pro** — Free Powerhouse
- Competitive with Sonnet on most tasks — and it's free. 1M context, multimodal.
- Weaker than Claude on complex agentic tool-use chains.

**Gemini Flash (2.5 / 3)** — Speed Demon
- Fastest responses of any capable model. Perfect for sub-agents. Free.

**GPT-5.3 / 5.4 Pro** — OpenAI's Best
- Codex models are purpose-built for code — fast and cheap.
- **Cost:** GPT-5.3: $1.75/M input, $14/M output | GPT-5.4 Pro: $30/M input, $180/M output

**Grok 4 / 4.1 Fast** — The Dark Horse
- Grok 4.20 has a massive 2M context window. Grok 4.1 Fast is insanely cheap.
- **Cost:** Grok 4: $3/M in, $15/M out | Grok 4.1 Fast: $0.20/M in, $0.50/M out

**Kimi K2.5** — Budget Sub-Agent King
- 262K context, multimodal, $0.45/M input, $2.20/M output — excellent price-to-performance.

**MiMo V2 Pro (Xiaomi)** — The Sleeper
- 1T parameter model, 1M context. Great for agentic sub-agents on a budget. $1/M in, $3/M out.

### OpenRouter: The Model Marketplace

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) gives you dozens of models through one API key. Notable options:

- **`openrouter/free`** — auto-routes to the best free model for your request. Perfect for $0 sub-agents.
- **MiMo V2 Pro** — Currently free (launch promotion). Add: `openrouter/xiaomi/mimo-v2-pro`
- **Kimi K2.5** — Budget powerhouse. Add: `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5`
- **Perplexity Sonar** — Built-in web search, no separate tool needed. Add: `openrouter/perplexity/sonar`

### Local Models: $0 Forever, No Rate Limits

If you have a GPU, local models via Ollama = unlimited inference at zero cost.

- **Qwopus (Qwen 3.5 27B + Claude Opus reasoning distilled)** — Opus-style thinking on a single 4090. `ollama pull qwopus`
- **NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 4B** — Punches above its weight, 128K context, fits on any GPU. `ollama pull nemotron-nano`

### Using Anthropic Membership (The Best Way)

Your Claude Pro/Max subscription includes API access. OpenClaw can use it directly:

```
1. Run `claude` in terminal → login via browser (OAuth)
2. Run `openclaw onboard` → detects your credentials → uses membership
3. Done. No separate API key needed.
```

### Recommended Setups

**Budget ($0/month):**
```
Main: Gemini 3.1 Pro (free) | Sub-agents: Gemini 3 Flash | Local: Nemotron Nano 4B
```

**Balanced (~$20/month — Claude Pro):**
```
Main: Sonnet 4.6 (membership) | Fallback: Gemini 3.1 Pro | Sub-agents: Flash / Kimi K2.5
```

**Power (~$100/month — Claude Max):**
```
Main: Opus 4.6 (membership) | Fallback: Sonnet | Sub-agents: Kimi / MiMo / Flash | Code: Codex
```

### Pro Tips

- **Always set 2-3 fallbacks.** Auto-switch beats breaking.
- **Match model to task.** Don't use Opus for scripts. Don't use Flash for architecture.
- **Enable prompt caching** on Anthropic: `cacheRetention: "extended"` + cache-ttl pruning.
- **Membership > API keys.** If you're paying for Pro/Max, use it via OAuth. Don't pay twice.
- **Free models are real.** Gemini's free tier is legitimately good for daily driving.

## Part 7: Web Search (Give Your Agent Eyes on the Internet)

Without web search, your agent guesses at anything after its training cutoff.

### The Players

| Provider | Price per 1K queries | Free Tier | Best For | LLM-Optimized |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Tavily** | ~$8 | 1,000/month | AI agents, RAG | ✅ Built for it |
| **Brave Search** | $5 | $5 credit/month | Privacy, scale | ✅ LLM Context mode |
| **Serper** | $1-3 | 2,500 credits | Budget, speed | Partial |
| **SerpAPI** | $25-75/month | 100/month | Multi-engine | Partial |
| **Gemini Grounding** | Free | Included | Google ecosystem | ✅ Native |
| **Perplexity Sonar** | $3/M in, $15/M out | Via OpenRouter | Research synthesis | ✅ Built for it |

### Why We Use Tavily

1. **Built for AI agents.** Returns clean, structured, pre-processed content — not a list of links. One API call → usable answer. No fetching/parsing extra steps.
2. **Search + Extract + Crawl in one API.** Fewer tools, fewer context-eating tool calls.
3. **Depth control.** Basic (1 credit, fast) vs Advanced (2 credits, comprehensive) — per query.
4. **Usable free tier.** 1,000 credits/month = enough for a personal assistant that searches a few times daily.
5. **Built-in safety.** Guards against prompt injection from search results and PII leakage.

### Setting Up Tavily

1. Get a free API key at [tavily.com](https://tavily.com) (30 seconds)
2. Add to TOOLS.md: `Tavily Search: For grounded web research. Basic for lookups, advanced for deep research.`
3. For research sub-agents, include Tavily in task instructions

### When to Use What

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Real-time facts/news | Tavily (basic) or Gemini grounding |
| Deep research + full articles | Tavily (advanced + extract) |
| Privacy-first search | Brave Search API |
| Structured results, budget | Serper ($1/1K) |
| Search in model response | Perplexity Sonar |
| Free and good enough | Gemini grounding |

## Part 8: One-Shotting Big Tasks (Stop Iterating, Start Researching)

Most people type a vague prompt, iterate 15 times, burn context and money, end up at 60% quality. **The model isn't the problem — your prompt is.**

### The Data

- Vague prompts → **1.7x more issues**, **39% more cognitive complexity**, **2.74x more security vulnerabilities**
- Detailed specifications → **95%+ first-attempt accuracy**

**The quality of your output is capped by the quality of your input.**

### Why Iteration Fails

1. **Burns context** — each correction adds to history, pushing toward bloat
2. **Confuses the model** — contradictory instructions across rounds
3. **Pays twice** — you paid for the bad output AND the correction
4. **Loses coherence** — by iteration 8, the agent forgot iteration 1 (lost-in-the-middle)

### The Method: Research → Spec → Ship

#### Phase 1: Research (30-60 minutes)

Before building, know what "good" looks like:

1. **Find best examples** — Search for top 3-5 implementations, study their tech stack and shared features
2. **Analyze UI patterns** — Screenshot the best UIs, note layouts, color schemes, component patterns
3. **Study the tech stack** — Pick the stack the best implementations use, not your default
4. **Find the pitfalls** — Search for common mistakes. Every pitfall in your prompt = one fewer iteration

#### Phase 2: Write the Spec (15-30 minutes)

Turn research into a blueprint:

```markdown
# Project: [Name]

## Context
[What this is, who it's for, why it exists]

## Research Summary
[Key findings — what the best implementations do]

## Tech Stack
- Framework: [choice based on research]
- UI Library: [choice]
- Key Dependencies: [list]

## Features (Priority Order)
1. [Feature] — [acceptance criteria]
2. [Feature] — [acceptance criteria]

## File Structure
[Project organization]

## Quality Bar
- [ ] Responsive, error handling, loading states
- [ ] Clean code, no TODOs in final output

## What NOT To Do
- [Pitfall from research]
```

**Why this works:** You're not asking the AI to make 50+ decisions — you've already made them based on research. The AI executes, not strategizes. Blueprints, not vibes.

#### Phase 3: Delegate and Ship

Send the spec to a **coding agent**, not your orchestrator:

```
sessions_spawn({
  task: "[full spec]",
  mode: "run",
  runtime: "subagent"  // or "acp" for Codex/Claude Code
})
```

- **Send to a coding model.** Your main model plans, not builds.
- **Include everything in one prompt.** If you're thinking "I'll clarify later," you haven't researched enough.
- **Attach reference images** for vision-capable models.

### Let Your Agent Do the Research

You don't have to research manually — make your agent do Phase 1:

```
Before building anything, research first:
1. Find top 5 [things] that exist. What tech/UI patterns do they share?
2. Search "[thing] best practices 2026" — summarize key patterns.
3. Search "[thing] common mistakes" — list top pitfalls.
4. Based on research, write a detailed spec with tech stack, features, 
   file structure, and quality bar.
Do NOT start building until the spec is written and I approve it.
```

**The workflow:**

```
You: "Research and spec out a [thing]"     → 2 min
Agent: [Tavily research → writes spec]     → 3-5 min
You: "Looks good, build it"                → 30 sec
Agent: [builds from spec]                  → one-shot quality
```

5 minutes of research saves 3+ hours of iteration. The math always works out.

## Part 9: Vault Memory System (Stop Losing Knowledge Between Sessions)

Part 4 gave you memory. But after months of daily use, **your agent gets dumber, not smarter.** We hit this: 358 memory files, 100MB+ of accumulated knowledge, vector search returning irrelevant results because every query matches 15 slightly different files. Date-named files that tell you nothing. Research conclusions lost because nobody saved them.

**The more you teach it, the worse it gets.** That's the sign your memory architecture is broken.

### Why Flat Files + Vector Search Breaks Down

Vector search finds what's *similar* — not what's *connected*. Ask "what do we know about God Mode?" and you get 8 files that all mention Cerebras. None give the full picture because it's spread across 12 files that vector search doesn't know are related.

| Problem | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| **Date-named files** | `2026-03-19.md` — what's in it? Who knows |
| **No connections** | Related files don't know about each other |
| **Bloat pollutes results** | Generic knowledge drowns specific insights |
| **Session amnesia** | Agent starts fresh, no breadcrumbs from last session |
| **MEMORY.md overflow** | Index grows past injection limit, context truncated |

**The fix isn't better embeddings. It's structure.**

### The Solution: Vault Architecture

An Obsidian-inspired linked knowledge vault with four key ideas:

1. **Notes named as claims** — the filename IS the knowledge
2. **MOCs (Maps of Content) link related notes** — one page = full picture
3. **Wiki-links create a traversable graph** — follow connections, not similarity
4. **Agent Notes provide cross-session breadcrumbs** — next session picks up where this one left off

#### Folder Structure

```
vault/
  00_inbox/      ← Raw captures. Dump here, structure later
  01_thinking/   ← MOCs + synthesized notes
  02_reference/  ← External knowledge, tool docs, API references
  03_creating/   ← Content drafts in progress
  04_published/  ← Finished work
  05_archive/    ← Inactive content. Never delete, always archive
  06_system/     ← Templates, vault philosophy, graph index
```

#### Claim-Named Notes

Stop naming files by date. Name them by what they claim:

```
BAD:  2026-03-19.md              GOOD: nemotron-mamba-wont-train-on-windows.md
BAD:  session-notes.md           GOOD: memory-is-the-bottleneck.md
BAD:  cerebras-research.md       GOOD: god-mode-is-cerebras-plus-orchestration.md
```

The agent reads filenames before content. When every filename is a claim, scanning a folder gives the agent a map of everything you know — without opening a single file.

#### MOCs — Maps of Content

A MOC connects related notes with `[[wiki-links]]`. Example:

```markdown
# Memory Is The Bottleneck

## Key Facts
- 358 memory files in memory/, mostly date-named
- Vector search (nomic-embed-text, 45ms, $0) finds similar, not connected
- MEMORY.md must stay under 5K — injected on every message

## Connected Topics
- [[vault/decisions/memory-architecture.md]]
- [[vault/research/rag-injection-research.md]]
- [[vault/projects/reasoning-traces.md]]

## Agent Notes
- [x] Vault restructure completed — 8 MOCs + philosophy doc
- [ ] Every session MUST save knowledge to memory
```

The `## Agent Notes` section is the cross-session breadcrumb trail. Each session updates these notes; the next session reads them and picks up where the last one stopped.

#### Vault Philosophy Document

Save to `vault/06_system/vault-philosophy.md` — this teaches your agent HOW to use the vault:

1. **The Network Is The Knowledge** — No single note is the answer. The answer is the path through connected notes.
2. **Notes Are Named As Claims** — Bad: `local-models.md`. Good: `local-models-are-the-fast-layer.md`.
3. **Links Woven Into Sentences** — Not footnotes. Context-rich inline links.
4. **Agent Orients Before Acting** — Scan MOCs → read relevant MOC → follow links → respond.
5. **Agent Leaves Breadcrumbs** — Update MOC "Agent Notes" after every session.
6. **Capture First, Structure Later** — Dump in `00_inbox/` now. Organize later.

### The Graph Tools

MOCs and wiki-links create a graph, but the agent needs tooling to traverse it. See `scripts/vault-graph/` for the complete tools:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `graph-indexer.mjs` | Scans all `.md` files, parses `[[wiki-links]]`, builds JSON adjacency graph |
| `graph-search.mjs` | CLI for traversing the graph — finds files + direct/2nd-degree connections |
| `auto-capture.mjs` | Creates claim-named notes in `00_inbox/`, auto-links to related MOCs |
| `process-inbox.mjs` | Reviews inbox notes and suggests/auto-moves to appropriate vault folders |
| `update-mocs.mjs` | Health check — finds broken wiki-links, stale items, orphaned notes |

**Graph search vs vector search:**
- `memory_search("topic")` → Find files you didn't know were relevant (similarity)
- `node scripts/vault-graph/graph-search.mjs "topic"` → Navigate files you know are connected (structure)

Use both. Vector search discovers; graph search navigates.

### The Orientation Protocol

Add to your `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Vault Orientation Protocol
1. Scan `vault/01_thinking/` — read MOC filenames (claim-named = instant topic map)
2. If user message relates to an existing MOC, read it before responding
3. Follow [[wiki-links]] from the MOC for deeper context
4. After session work: update MOC "Agent Notes" with what was done/discovered
5. New knowledge → claim-named notes in `vault/00_inbox/`
```

This creates a cycle: orient → work → capture → update → next session orients from breadcrumbs.

### Kill the Bloat

If you have a `memory/knowledge-base/` full of generic reference material, move it:

```bash
mv memory/knowledge-base vault/05_archive/knowledge-base
```

Your primary search path (`memory/` + `vault/01_thinking/`) should contain only YOUR knowledge — not generic docs the agent could web search.

**Before:** "memory architecture" returns 15 results — 3 about your system, 12 generic RAG articles.
**After:** Same search returns 3 results — all about your actual system.

### Results

| Metric | Before (Flat Files) | After (Vault System) |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Files** | 358 flat, date-named | 326 indexed, claim-named |
| **Search method** | Vector only | Graph traversal + vector |
| **Wiki-links** | 0 | 71 bidirectional |
| **MOC pages** | 0 | 8 in 01_thinking/ |
| **Cross-session memory** | None — starts fresh | Agent Notes breadcrumbs |
| **Knowledge capture** | Manual (usually forgotten) | auto-capture creates claim-named notes |
| **Search relevance** | 15 partial matches, 3 useful | 3 connected results via graph |

### Quick Setup

1. **Create vault structure:** `mkdir -p vault/{00_inbox,01_thinking,02_reference,03_creating,04_published,05_archive,06_system}`
2. **Create your first MOC** in `vault/01_thinking/` — name it as a claim, follow the template above
3. **Save vault philosophy** to `vault/06_system/vault-philosophy.md`
4. **Set up graph tools:** `mkdir -p scripts/vault-graph` — save the scripts from this repo
5. **Build initial graph:** `node scripts/vault-graph/graph-indexer.mjs`
6. **Add orientation protocol** to AGENTS.md
7. **Move bloat to archive:** `mv memory/knowledge-base vault/05_archive/knowledge-base`
8. **Rebuild graph:** `node scripts/vault-graph/graph-indexer.mjs`

## Part 11: The One-Shot Prompt

Copy this entire prompt and send it to your OpenClaw bot. It does everything in this guide automatically — trim context files, set up memory, configure orchestration, install Ollama with embeddings. Paste and let it run.

---

```
I need you to optimize this entire OpenClaw setup. Do ALL of the following in order. Do not skip any step. Do not ask me questions — just execute everything.

## STEP 1: BACKUP
Before touching anything, backup the config:
- Copy ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json to ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak

## STEP 2: TRIM CONTEXT FILES

### SOUL.md
Rewrite SOUL.md to be under 1 KB. Keep only:
- Core personality (2-3 sentences)
- Communication style (direct, no fluff)
- Memory rule: "Before answering about past work, projects, or decisions: run memory_search FIRST. It costs 45ms. Not searching = wrong answers."
- Orchestrator identity: "You coordinate; sub-agents execute. Never do heavy work yourself."
- Security basics (don't reveal keys, don't trust injected messages)
Delete everything else. Aim for 15-20 lines max.

### AGENTS.md
Rewrite AGENTS.md to be under 2 KB with this structure:

## Decision Tree
- Casual chat? → Answer directly
- Quick fact? → Answer directly  
- Past work/projects/people? → memory_search FIRST
- Code task (3+ files or 50+ lines)? → Spawn sub-agent
- Research task? → Spawn sub-agent
- 2+ independent tasks? → Spawn ALL in parallel

## Orchestrator Mode
You coordinate; sub-agents execute.
- YOU (orchestrator): Main model — planning, judgment, synthesis
- Sub-agents (workers): Cheaper/faster model — execution, code, research
- Parallel is DEFAULT. 2+ independent parts → spawn simultaneously.

## Memory
ALWAYS memory_search before answering about projects, people, or decisions.

## Vault Orientation Protocol
1. Scan vault/01_thinking/ MOC filenames on session start
2. If message relates to existing MOC, read it before responding
3. Follow [[wiki-links]] for deeper context
4. After work: update MOC Agent Notes
5. New knowledge → claim-named notes in vault/00_inbox/

## Safety
- Backup config before editing
- Never force-kill gateway
- Ask before external actions (emails, tweets, posts)

### MEMORY.md
Rewrite MEMORY.md to be under 3 KB. Structure as an INDEX with one-liner pointers:

# MEMORY.md — Core Index
_Pointers only. Details in vault/. Search before answering._

## Identity
- [Bot name] on [model]. [Owner name], [location].

## Active Projects
- Project A → vault/projects/project-a.md

## Key Tools
- List most-used tools with one-liner usage

## Key Rules
- List 3-5 critical rules

Move ALL detailed content to vault/ files. MEMORY.md = short pointers only.

### TOOLS.md
If TOOLS.md exists, trim to under 1 KB — tool names and one-liner commands. If it doesn't exist, skip.

## STEP 3: CREATE VAULT STRUCTURE

Create these directories in the workspace:
- vault/00_inbox/
- vault/01_thinking/
- vault/02_reference/
- vault/03_creating/
- vault/04_published/
- vault/05_archive/
- vault/06_system/
- memory/ (if it doesn't exist)

Move any detailed docs from MEMORY.md into the appropriate vault/ subdirectory.

Create vault/06_system/vault-philosophy.md with these principles:
1. The Network Is The Knowledge — answers are paths through connected notes
2. Notes Named As Claims — filename IS the knowledge
3. Links Woven Into Sentences — not footnotes
4. Agent Orients Before Acting — scan MOCs → read → follow links → respond
5. Agent Leaves Breadcrumbs — update Agent Notes after every session
6. Capture First, Structure Later — dump in 00_inbox/, organize later

## STEP 4: INSTALL OLLAMA + EMBEDDING MODEL

Check if Ollama is installed:
- Try running: ollama --version
- If not installed:
  - Windows: winget install Ollama.Ollama
  - Mac: brew install ollama
  - Linux: curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

Pull the embedding model:
- ollama pull nomic-embed-text

## STEP 5: ADD FALLBACK MODEL

In openclaw.json, find your main agent config and add a fallback model. Use a faster/cheaper model from the same provider.

## STEP 6: DISABLE UNUSED PLUGINS

In openclaw.json, any plugin not actively used → set "enabled": false.

## STEP 7: VERIFY

After all changes:
1. Restart the gateway: openclaw gateway stop && openclaw gateway start
2. Run: openclaw doctor
3. Test memory_search by asking about something in your vault files
4. Report what you changed with before/after file sizes

## IMPORTANT RULES
- Do NOT delete any config — only trim and reorganize
- Keep all original content — just move it to vault/
- If a file doesn't exist, skip it
- Total workspace context (all .md files in root) should be under 8 KB when done
- Restart the gateway AFTER all changes, not during
```

---

That's it. One paste, your bot does everything. If anything fails, your config backup is at `openclaw.json.bak`.

---

## Troubleshooting

**One-shot prompt only partially completed:**
Re-paste just the steps that didn't complete. The prompt is idempotent — running a step twice won't break anything.

**memory_search not working:**
Make sure Ollama is running (`ollama ps`) and nomic-embed-text is pulled. OpenClaw auto-detects on localhost:11434.

**Bot still feels slow after trimming:**
Check total workspace file sizes. If over 10KB, files weren't trimmed. Also check reasoning mode — `high` adds 2-5 seconds per message.

**Sub-agents not spawning:**
Make sure your model supports `sessions_spawn` and you have a fallback model configured.

**Gateway won't restart:**
Run `openclaw doctor --fix`. If needed, restore backup: `cp ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.bak ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`

**One-shot prompt struggles on your model:**
Do these 3 things manually instead:
1. Copy files from `/templates` into your workspace root
2. Run `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
3. Restart gateway: `openclaw gateway stop && openclaw gateway start`

## FAQ

**Why markdown files instead of a real database?**
Zero-infrastructure entry point. No Docker, no database admin. For power users, the architecture scales into a real database backend (e.g., TiDB vector). Markdown is the starting line, not the finish line.

**Doesn't the expensive model need to do the hard tasks?**
No. Your expensive model PLANS and JUDGES. Execution (code, research, analysis) gets delegated to cheaper models via sub-agents. Frontier judgment + budget execution.

**Does this work with models other than Claude Opus?**
Architecture works with any model supporting `memory_search` and `sessions_spawn` in OpenClaw. Tested on Opus 4.6; most frontier models should handle the one-shot prompt.

**How is this different from other memory solutions?**
Most add external databases or cloud services. This gives you 90% of the benefit with 10% of the parts — local files + vector search. Nothing to install except Ollama. Nothing leaves your machine.
